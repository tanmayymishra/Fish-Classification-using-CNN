# Fish-Classification-using-CNN
It is a Classification model which is performed using Deep Learning(CNN).
I used Kaggle Fish Classification dataset for this model - https://www.kaggle.com/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset
I've done pre-processing, model building & training and model evaluation.
To avoid overfitting I've done Data Augmentation and also used Dropout layers in my model.
